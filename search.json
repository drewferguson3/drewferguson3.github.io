    "text": "My name is Drew Ferguson and I am senior at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. I am currently working to get my Bachelor’s degree in Journalism in Sports Media and Communications, with a minor in Business Administration. I will be graduating in the May of 2025! Born in Omaha, Nebraska, I always knew that I wanted to be a Husker. As a kid, I loved playing sports and spending as much time as I could outside. Going through school, I always knew I wanted to do something that allowed me to show my creative side. In the College of Journalism and Mass Communications, I have been able to do exactly that. I have gained valuable experience behind the scenes (or camera,) creating graphics for different events, creating video packages, and being an on-air talent. All of these experiences have been nothing short of fulfilling. In the College of Business, I have been able to gain valuable skills relating entrepreneurship, finance, and of course, administration. Being able to combine these skills makes me feel more than ready to get out into the real world and impact any company that I have the privilege of joining. You can find links to my Instagram, LinkedIn, and GitHub on this page."
